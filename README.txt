Digger was originally created by Windmill Software in 1983 and released as a
copy-protected, bootable 5.25" floppy disk for the IBM PC. As it requires a
genuine CGA card, it didn't work on modern PCs.

In 1998, Andrew Jenner <aj@digger.org>, created Digger Remastered, which runs
on all PCs with CGA or better and plays just like the original. See his site
http://digger.org for more information about his remake, the history of the
game as well as the history of Windmill Software and their other games.

Later on, Maksym Sobolyev <sobomax@gmail.com>, ported Adnrew's code to run
on Linux/FreeBSD/Windows using SDL library, or on FreeBSD console using
native "VGL" VESA graphics interface. That version is now being actively
developed to move Digger into XXI century.

Furthermore, Michael Knigge <michael.knigge@gmx.de>, provided some minor
enhancements (i. e. switching fullscreen and window mode with F11), cleaned
up the code a little bit, fixed some minor bugs and provided an Installer
for Microsoft Windows.
